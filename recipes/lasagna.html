        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups (500g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (10g) fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat until no longer pink. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat this process, alternating layers of sauce, noodles, and cheese until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this delicious lasagna with your favorite salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.</li>
